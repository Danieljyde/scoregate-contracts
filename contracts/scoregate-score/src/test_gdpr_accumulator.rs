//! A sound GDPR deletion-witness accumulator, plus property-based fuzzing
//! of its soundness (issue #410, following up on the removal in #395).
//!
//! ## Why this exists as a standalone test module
//!
//! Issue #410 ("add fuzzing for GDPR deletion-witness soundness") explicitly
//! depends on a companion issue: a real accumulator to fuzz. The one
//! previously in this repo (`gdpr_accumulator.rs`) was removed in #395 for
//! being cryptographically unsound (a trivially factorable RSA-style
//! modulus, XOR-folding standing in for a real hash) — see `CHANGELOG.md`
//! [Unreleased] "Removed". Nothing has replaced it since.
//!
//! This module builds a new, sound accumulator from scratch and fuzzes it
//! here, as a `#[cfg(test)]`-only module: it is a pure data structure with
//! no dependency on contract storage, so it doesn't touch `submit_score`,
//! `clear_score`, or `clear_score_history` — wiring a chosen accumulator
//! into the live deletion path is a separate, deliberate integration
//! decision (matching how the original scaffold was *also* never wired into
//! those functions), out of scope here. What issue #410 actually asks for —
//! a soundness-fuzzed accumulator — is fully delivered without that wiring.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Every `(wallet, asset_pair)` that has ever been inserted gets exactly one
//! leaf, forever, at a position fixed by insertion order. A leaf's *value*
//! is either `PRESENT` or `DELETED`; deleting an entry flips its leaf value
//! (never its position), and the Merkle tree is rebuilt over the full,
//! updated leaf list. A **deletion witness** is a standard Merkle inclusion
//! proof — the same sibling-hash-walk construction already used and
//! reviewed for `submit_scores_batch_attested` (`hash_internal_node` /
//! `verify_merkle_proof` in `lib.rs`, RFC 9162-style domain separation) —
//! that the leaf at `key`'s position currently holds value `DELETED`,
//! against the tree's *current* root.
//!
//! ## Why this is sound (and the old scheme wasn't)
//!
//! - **Distinctness.** `key_hash(wallet, pair)` is a SHA-256 digest over a
//!   fixed-width encoding of `(wallet, asset_pair)` (mirroring
//!   `compute_commitment`'s wallet/pair field layout,
//!   `docs/attestation-spec.md` §3). Two different `(wallet, pair)` pairs
//!   collide only with SHA-256-collision probability, so every element gets
//!   its own tree position — a witness for one position cannot verify
//!   against a different one without also supplying different sibling
//!   values, which requires the *actual* tree data.
//! - **Freshness.** Verification is always against the tree's current root
//!   (rebuilt after every insert/delete). Re-inserting a deleted element
//!   flips its leaf back to `PRESENT`, which changes that leaf's hash and
//!   therefore the root, so any previously-generated deletion witness for
//!   it stops verifying.
//! - **Contrast with the currently-present (and unsound)
//!   `get_membership_proof`/`verify_membership` in `lib.rs`/`verkle.rs`:**
//!   that scheme's "witness" is `H(domain || commitment || z || v)` —
//!   computable from wholly public inputs, with **no dependency on the
//!   accumulator's actual contents**. Anyone can compute a "valid" witness
//!   for *any* `(z, v)` pair, member or not, real accumulator state or
//!   fabricated. That is a live soundness gap in this codebase, separate
//!   from issue #410 (worth its own follow-up); this module deliberately
//!   does not reuse that pattern. A witness here only verifies if its
//!   sibling hashes are correct outputs of the real leaf list.
